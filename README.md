Hi there, i'm  srgantmoomoo. I got into coding around July 2020 and it's something i genuinly enjoy doing now.  I bassically only know java, I would like to learn basic C and C++ and eventually get into web development.

- BasedBase, a public minecraft forge 1.12.2 client base, meant to be as simple as possible for anyone to use.
