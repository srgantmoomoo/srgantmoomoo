## SrgantMooMoo
Hi, I'm SrgantMooMoo. I got into coding around July of 2020 and it's something I genuinely enjoy doing now. The majority of my projects have to do with minecraft modding.

I mostly know Java, Java is on top, but I also know Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Rust, and SQL. Some languages I wanna learn in the near future are C and Go.

## Projects

  - [bedroom](https://github.com/beach-house-development/bedroom), a latest version Fabric project for Minecraft, made to serve as a base for minecraft clients. this was originally made as the base for beach house.
