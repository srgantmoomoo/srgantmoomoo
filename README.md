Hi there, i'm  SrgantMooMoo. I got into coding around July 2020 and it's something I genuinly enjoy doing now.  I bassically only know java and the majority of my projects right now have to do with minecraft modding, I would like to learn basic C and C++ and eventually java script and get into web development in general.

## projects 
- postman, a public minecraft forge 1.12.2 client for anarchy servers.
- BasedBase, a public (soon) minecraft forge 1.12.2 client base, meant to be as simple as possible for anyone to use.
- Las Venturas, a private minecraft 1.12.2 client in mcp that i'm mostly doing for the fun of it.
- beach house, a private minecraft 1.16.4 fabirc client for anarchy i'm working on to get accustomed to fabric and 1.16.4 modding.
