## SrgantMooMoo
Hi there, I'm SrgantMooMoo. I got into coding around July of 2020 and it's something I genuinely enjoy doing now. The majority of my projects right now have to do with minecraft modding.

I mostly know Java, Java is on top, but I also know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some languages I wanna learn in the near future are Python, C, and Go.

## Projects 
**works in progress** <br>
- [beach house](https://github.com/beach-house-development), a latest version Fabric client for Minecraft.
  - [bedroom](https://github.com/beach-house-development/bedroom), a latest version Fabric project for Minecraft, made to serve as a base for minecraft clients. This was originally made as the base for beach house.

**unfinished** <br>
- [Moo Base](https://github.com/moomooooo/postman), a public Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 client base, meant to be as simple as possible for anyone to use.
- [get-on-top-of.me](https://github.com/moomooooo/get-on-top-of.me), a personal website that I was doing for fun to help me get into web dev, the domain has since been repurposed for another one of my projects.
- Las Venturas, a private Minecraft 1.12.2 client in MCP that I was mostly doing for the fun of it.
