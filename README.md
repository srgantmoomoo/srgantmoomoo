## SrgantMooMoo
Hi there, I'm SrgantMooMoo. I got into coding around July 2020 and it's something I genuinely enjoy doing now.  I mostly know and enjoy Java, but I also know HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript, C#, and Python. The majority of my projects right now have to do with minecraft modding. I eventually want to learn C, C++, Go, and some others.

## Projects 
**works in progress** <br>
- beach house, a private latest version fabric client for minecraft, based off bedroom.
- bedroom, a public latest version fabric base for minecraft clients, made originally for beach house.

**unfinished** <br>
- Moo Base, a public minecraft forge 1.12.2 client base, meant to be as simple as possible for anyone to use.
- get-on-top-of.me, a personal website that i waas doing for fun to help me get into web dev, the domain has since been repurposed for another one of my projects.
- Las Venturas, a private minecraft 1.12.2 client in mcp that i was mostly doing for the fun of it.
- postman, a public minecraft forge 1.12.2 client for anarchy servers.
  - postman++, a paid extension of postman with a few exclusive features.
